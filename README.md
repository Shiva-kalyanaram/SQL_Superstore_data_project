# SQL_Superstore_data_project

# My First SQL Project

I am excited to share my first project on SQL where I loaded the sample super store data from Google.

## Tasks and Queries

1. **Data Source**:
    - Downloaded super store data from Google.

2. **Table Creation**:
    - Created tables in SQL: `order`, `person`, `returns`.

3. **Table Joining**:
    - Created a new table using JOIN operations based on keys: `order`, `person`, `returns` table with columns `orderid`, `person`.

4. **Data Analysis**:
    - Analyzed city-wise sales and profit.
    - Found segment-wise max sales, discounts, and profit.
    - Determined city-wise top 3 sales.

5. **Stored Procedures**:
    - Created stored procedures for all the above 6 tasks.
